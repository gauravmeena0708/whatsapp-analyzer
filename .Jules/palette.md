## 2024-05-15 - ARIA Roles for Custom Spinners
**Learning:** Custom CSS spinners implemented as `<div>` elements are invisible to screen readers without ARIA roles. Adding `role="status"` and `aria-label` provides necessary context.
**Action:** Always add `role="status"` and `aria-label="Loading..."` to custom CSS-only loading indicators across all views.

## 2024-05-18 - Canvas Accessibility for Screen Readers
**Learning:** <canvas> elements are opaque to screen readers by default. Adding `role="img"` and an `aria-label` ensures visually impaired users are aware that a chart or data visualization is present on the page.
**Action:** Always add `role="img"` and descriptive `aria-label` to all `<canvas>` elements across HTML templates and dynamically generated plots.

## 2024-05-20 - Communicating Async State on Inputs
**Learning:** While buttons trigger async operations and often receive `disabled` and `aria-busy` states, associated file inputs (like `chatFileInput`) are often overlooked. Leaving inputs enabled during async reading can allow unintended re-triggers. Adding `disabled` and `aria-busy="true"` to both the input and associated UI elements (like primary buttons or dropdowns) ensures the full interactive surface is locked down and communicates progress to assistive tech.
**Action:** Always disable and set `aria-busy="true"` on file inputs alongside their submit buttons during asynchronous read operations, ensuring states are reverted in `finally` or `onerror` blocks.

## 2024-06-19 - Tooltips for Disabled States
**Learning:** Interactive elements that are disabled by default (like 'Analyze' buttons or dropdowns before file upload) are frustrating because users might not know *why* they can't click them. Furthermore, elements disabled during async tasks (like file parsing) should explain the current state.
**Action:** Always add native `title` attributes to disabled elements explaining the required precondition (e.g., 'Upload a file first'), and dynamically update them to reflect loading states (e.g., 'Reading chat file...') to provide continuous feedback.
