## 2024-05-15 - ARIA Roles for Custom Spinners
**Learning:** Custom CSS spinners implemented as `<div>` elements are invisible to screen readers without ARIA roles. Adding `role="status"` and `aria-label` provides necessary context.
**Action:** Always add `role="status"` and `aria-label="Loading..."` to custom CSS-only loading indicators across all views.

## 2024-05-18 - Canvas Accessibility for Screen Readers
**Learning:** <canvas> elements are opaque to screen readers by default. Adding `role="img"` and an `aria-label` ensures visually impaired users are aware that a chart or data visualization is present on the page.
**Action:** Always add `role="img"` and descriptive `aria-label` to all `<canvas>` elements across HTML templates and dynamically generated plots.

## 2024-05-20 - Communicating Async State on Inputs
**Learning:** While buttons trigger async operations and often receive `disabled` and `aria-busy` states, associated file inputs (like `chatFileInput`) are often overlooked. Leaving inputs enabled during async reading can allow unintended re-triggers. Adding `disabled` and `aria-busy="true"` to both the input and associated UI elements (like primary buttons or dropdowns) ensures the full interactive surface is locked down and communicates progress to assistive tech.
**Action:** Always disable and set `aria-busy="true"` on file inputs alongside their submit buttons during asynchronous read operations, ensuring states are reverted in `finally` or `onerror` blocks.
## 2025-02-19 - Accessible Tooltips for Disabled States
**Learning:** In the standalone HTML analyzer UI, disabled interactive elements (like `select` and `button`) lacked context, leaving users confused about why they couldn't proceed. Additionally, error handling incorrectly re-enabled elements when preconditions (like parsing files) failed. Using native `title` attributes dynamically toggled by JavaScript effectively guides users while remaining lightweight.
**Action:** Always pair disabled states with native HTML `title` attributes or ARIA descriptions explaining the required action. Ensure error recovery paths (`onerror`, `catch`) strictly maintain the disabled state if the required precondition isn't met.
